# gulp


this is only the begining of my gulp system

Now it can compile sass, create svg sprites and just copy some files (fonts now).

But it is so preety with lazyTask from [I.Kantor](http://learn.javascript.ru/screencast/gulp) and [gulp-load-plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-load-plugins).
